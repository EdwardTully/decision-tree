Building simple form decision tree/algorithm.  As I work on this, I see how redux would be very helpful.  What I want is the component in 
the container to change as the drilling progresses.  What I have a route to new components as the drill goes on.  Not what I had in mind.  On option B2 I have an input for numeric options, which are evaluated and directed to appropriate component. This part has a bad hehavior where the send button needs to be inputted twice to go to the new 'page'.  I would like to provide the user with a visual way to keep track of the options selected.  I think this would be a good use for redux...
